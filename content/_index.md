## Welcome

CloudHedge enables Enterprise IT to move applications to AWS with minimum investment and maximum advantage. CloudHedge OmniDeq<sup>TM</sup> is the industry's 1st Automated Refactoring and Containerization solution.

OmniDeq<sup>TM</sup> - CloudHedge’s SaaS platform enables a user to leverage all three tools; Discover, Transform, and Cruize as a service. As the platform is hosted by CloudHedge, the customer team only needs to use their respective login account on CloudHedge Portal (https://app.cloudhedge.io). We don’t install any agent onto the host/ environment, however, there are some prerequisites which are required to be met.

Virtual appliances are leveraged by customers who are unable to access the SaaS platform (e.g. air gap or locked down environments). All three tools in the OmniDeq<sup>TM</sup> app modernization work the same way with the same features. In case of virtual appliances, customers need to download and set up the OmniDeq<sup>TM</sup> platform as an appliance within their data center. Instructions for this setup are provided separately by CloudHedge Professional Services team.
