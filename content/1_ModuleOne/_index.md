# Introduction

**CloudHedge**’s patented and automated App Modernization Platform – **OmniDeq<sup>TM</sup>** powered by **R6Ai<sup>TM</sup>** - modernizes legacy applications (Windows, AIX and Linux) into containers by reHost/reFactor/rePlatform and creates a well-defined path for enterprises to leverage AWS. Moreover, the modernization is not, just changing the deployment target of the application from on-premises to cloud. With **OmniDeq<sup>TM</sup>**, the entire transformation is leveled up by containerizing the applications and making it agile, scalable, flexible, and cost efficient, making it cloud-native. In addition, the approach works even if the application is already on cloud. Using automation, enterprise customers can now modernize 100s of applications to AWS in a fraction of time with confidence using **OmniDeq<sup>TM</sup>**.

**REMOVE:** With the exception of _index.md, the module folders and filenames should be changed to better reflect their content, i.e. 1_Planning as the folder and 11_HowToBegin as the first submodule. Changing the "weight" value of the header is ultimately what reflects the order the modules are presented.
