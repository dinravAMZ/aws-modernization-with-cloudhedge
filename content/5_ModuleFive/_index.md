# Modernizing The Applications
<br>

**CloudHedge OmniDeq<sup>TM</sup> DTC information**

- **Discovery** scans applications and unearths a lot of dependencies which may not be documented - gives the true picture of the apps (Linux and Windows)
- **Transform** enables containerization of applications. Along with the information captured in discovery it knows how to containerize an application’s service/ process, it produces a container image and publish it into the repository.
- **Cruize** Post containerization of application’s processes, aggregating multiple
containers and deploying them as one or multiple applications on Kubernetes
cluster can be challenging for a person who has no/limited experience with Kubernetes. Cruize helps to create Kubernetes configuration files and facilitate
drag and drop deployments.
